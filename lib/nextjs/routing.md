# [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)

Next.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.

`layout.tsx` Shared UI for a segment and its children

`page.tsx` Unique UI of a route and make routes publicly accessible

`not-found.tsx` Not found UI for a segment and its children
